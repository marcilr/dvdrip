  dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl.  It provides an
  easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost all aspects of the
  ripping and transcoding process.  It uses the widely known video processing
  swissknife transcode and many other Open Source tools.  dvd::rip itself is
  licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic License.

  "And note: it's spelt dvd::rip, and nothing else."
